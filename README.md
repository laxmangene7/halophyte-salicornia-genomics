# halophyte-salicornia-genomics
We assembled six chromosome-scale Salicornia genomes and analyzed 318 accessions from a resequencing panel. Our results reveal taxonomic inconsistencies and substantial genetic diversity, providing a genomic foundation for breeding and neo-domestication of this halophyte for saline agriculture.
